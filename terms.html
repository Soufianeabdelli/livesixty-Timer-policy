Terms of Service for [Livesoon-Timer]
Last Updated: [14/11/2025]
Welcome to [Livesoon-Timer] (the "App"), a tool designed to provide a "Starting Soon" countdown timer and automatic chat notification for your TikTok LIVE streams.
By using our App, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms").
1. Description of Service
The App is a streaming tool that provides a customizable overlay for TikTok LIVE. Its features include:
A "Starting Soon" countdown timer.
Customizable themes and text.
An optional service that, upon your authorization, sends a one-time message (which you define) to your own TikTok LIVE chat when the timer ends.
2. User Authorization
To use the automatic notification feature, you must explicitly authorize the App through TikTok's official OAuth 2.0 process. You will be asked to grant permission for:
user.info.basic (to identify your account)
live.chat.send (to send the single notification on your behalf)
We will never use these permissions for any purpose other than providing the core, stated function of the App.
3. User Responsibilities
You are solely responsible for the content of the chat notification message you set.
You are responsible for complying with all TikTok LIVE and community guidelines.
You agree not to use the App to send spam, hateful content, or any messages that violate TikTok's policies.
4. Limitation of Liability
The App is provided "as is." We are not responsible for any stream interruptions, loss of revenue, or issues that may arise from using this tool. We do not guarantee the App will be online or error-free 100% of the time.
5. Termination
You may stop using the App at any time by revoking its permissions in your TikTok account settings. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the App for any user who violates these Terms.
6. Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms in the future. We will notify users of any significant changes.
7. Contact
